# Algo-FinalProject

In this Code we set up a dijkstra algorithm to help navigate electric car users to the nearest charging station.

In this code we have already added a prebuilt graph in it, but if you are using external graph information, then you can change it by getting rid of the graph and instead nameing your external graph in the graph instance ("graph = Graph(Add your graph)")

For the code, it runs by asking the user where their location is to begin navigating, and then it routes the distance to all charging stations, then gives you the distance of the nearest charging station.
